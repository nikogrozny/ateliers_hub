this one s mine
khans attack
khans are the strong
i cannot be touched
you are not worthy of combat with me
i ain t for this
this is what we do to vermin
this is how we handle trouble in shady sands
this ll learn you
may you die of thirst alone and cold
your number is up
ow busted my nose
ow you broke it
ow you broke it
damn it that hurt
this is what we do to troublemakers
ow damn busted nose
ow you broke it
ow you broke it
by dharma that hurt
