forward sister
they retreat after them
onward children of atom
box them in let none escape atom s fire
swoop around them children
we must surround them
atom is my armor
no atom protect me
grant me wings of fire brothers
she returns to atom
our sisters are dying
atom grant me vengeance
atom s glow fades
die and be cleansed
i see nothing but atom s light
step out into atom s light
just the wind nothing to warrant atom s fury
behold atom s light
suffer suffer and be cleansed
children we are beset
