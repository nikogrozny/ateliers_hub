you asked for this
why did you start this
you broke my arm
you broke my arm
your time is up
human weapons cannot harm me
nobody save you now
this is how you die
was that an attack
you cannot hurt me there
why you attack me there
those who oppose unity must be swept aside
welcome to your grave
this is the master s touch
your attack is as weak as your spirit
you cannot hurt the chosen
you humans are weak
argh die
you have earned days of agony for this
holy flame protect me
