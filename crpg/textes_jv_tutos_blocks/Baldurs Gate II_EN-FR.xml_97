you outstayed your welcome
hello again i trust you are enjoying in all its meager splendor
scroll speed
potion of power
new game
load game
save game
quit game
die here you will
ahead many of them must be stopped
begone and do what ye must
can i be you
filthy creatures you will harm no more
you caused all this then you will die die and rot
destroyer of beauty i swear that you will die
may all nine hells have at thee
