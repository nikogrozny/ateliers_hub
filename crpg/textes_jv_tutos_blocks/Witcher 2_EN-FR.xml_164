just die
th th this is all w we h have left i s swear
the choice is simple
what s your point constable
be careful you may not be so lucky next time
here take this pouch
faster with those logs
co sta o si
is that what they teach you on the gauntlet
just you wait
you no business here
listen creep stop meddling in other people s business
you have it coming
they stopped trusting me
wait till i bless you
just you wait
manners of a troll
where s my whip
nobody wants you here
the ripper is afoot
