your heart is mine breton
run while you can
this one is no more
enslaver die
you are clumsy snowman
this one is no more
enslaver die
you are clumsy snowman
you lost this round
die scoundrel
run while you can
escape while you can
you will die here
escape while you can
die with honor coward
you will die here
this is too easy
now this is fighting
it will be your blood here not mine
this is too easy
