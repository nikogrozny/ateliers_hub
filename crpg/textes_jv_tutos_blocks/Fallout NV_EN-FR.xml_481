as with service holograms security holograms cannot leave emitter range they will pursue a target to the emitter s perimeter however this usually allows a target to be subdued and should present no obstacle to casino security
if security holograms detect unauthorized guests or detect criminal action they will display a warning caution color to the target if you believe they ever display this color in error immediately move away from the hologram s field of view until they resume their normal protocol if the behavior persists they will enter engagement mode turn red and attempt to subdue targets with their discharge beams note as requested in the service contract n e has installed systems in all sierra madre security hologram emitters
security holograms use field of view sensors to perceive their environment and to aid in while later versions will feature upgrades that allow for a degree perception arc the memory cells in current hologram emitters can only perceive their environment in a cone in front of them they can however change facing as needed and scan their environment for unauthorized activity it is best to purchase security hologram emitters in pairs to cover a full view of the environment as trespassers could conceivably use hologram to gain access to unauthorized areas
holograms are programmed with service protocols and security protocols service protocol holograms perform a specific function greeters simple vendors or in the case of the sierra madre casino itself even monitoring gambling tables these service holograms follow simple routines and are incapable of performing any security function holograms cannot move beyond range of their emitters and are best when used for a simple localized function
