i cannot be touched
you are not worthy of combat with me
you broke my arm
your kung fu is better than mine
you are truly mighty goodbye
evil triumphs
i advise you to flee
only a coward uses weapons
flee while you can
only a coward uses weapons
your powers are weak
your kung fu cannot hurt me
float like a butterfly
who s jack burton
must protect spleen hole
don t make me use the cheat knife
i railed your ass
you want some of this
missed my spleen ha ha
boy you are a bleeder aren t ya
