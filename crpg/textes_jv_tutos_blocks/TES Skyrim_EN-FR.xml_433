targets in mid swing drop their weapons
you rush forward almost instantaneously
an area effect knockdown with a slight component
fire breath for dragons only
once a day affected animals will be your allies
voice of the emperor
once a day nearby people are calmed and will not start combat
once a day affected enemies do half damage
howl of the pack
