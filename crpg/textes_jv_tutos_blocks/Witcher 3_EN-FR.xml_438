wait what was that
eternal fire
save yourselves
neighbors were so envious of that horse and then
this was cheaper at the other stall
watch where you step
mysterious note
allow me sirrah to peruse your wares
eternal fire
hold on
weapon
have mercy on me
i want to attack a temple guard transport
return to
throw bones
there was an ugly creature here
light the torches
find a black pearl using your witcher senses
eternal fire
gray but so coarse
