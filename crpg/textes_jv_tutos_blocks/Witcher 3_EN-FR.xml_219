the servant s heart melted he wept at the sight
the servant s heart melted he wept at the sight
s dead drank poison and i i couldn t save her
show me your wares
bart stop that now
hide the children bar the doors quick
it led me here gotta talk to the baron
you mean bart nice
no chance
it turns out he ll not come after all
around me thundered the noise of the street in mourning an image of majestic distress with dainty fingers lifting the hem of her dress a stately woman strode by with hurrying feet
tamara my daughter turned nineteen in the spring slender lass about yea tall comes up to my shoulders
i beg ye do it quick
and then
sorry you lost me
especially not this one
calm down ladies no poet s worth two sisters nipping at each other s throats
no evil can survive the holy fire the holy fire enlightens burns and cleanses
not interested in your squabbles
casino where is it
