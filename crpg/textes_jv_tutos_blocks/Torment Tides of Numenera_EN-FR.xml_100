they have me surrounded
making a note
my legacy has shifted
i learned something new
my understanding has increased
you dare strike me
my cyphers are making me ill
much better
forward onward
they have me surrounded
making a note
my legacy has shifted
this will be helpful
my enemies will fear me fear me more i mean
you fear me you know you fear me
your death is upon you
the darkness is mine
this is no time for jokes
you can t hide from me
you can stand and fight if you want
