that will scar nicely
your magic is powerful
you cannot steal my soul that way
your magic cannot kill me
my guts are on fire
i been torn open
must continue must slay enemy
the has slain me
damn these pesky intestines
i will burn off your foot for that
the darkness is here
my sight has been stolen
you fight without honor
in high squeaky voice ouch
i used right guard
you broke my arm
i left my heart
that tickled my ribs
you gored my s
you can raise welts like nobody else
