who dare bother chosen
you make me angry
human weapons cannot harm me
no mercy to enemies
nobody save you now
i break your body
i hurt you much
was that an attack
you can hurt me but you cannot win
you almost hurt chosen
why you attack me there
you pay for this later
human weapons cannot harm me
i see enemies to destroy
nobody save you now
we are your masters
we are the chosen
there is no pain that can hurt me
i hate your kind
why you attack me there
