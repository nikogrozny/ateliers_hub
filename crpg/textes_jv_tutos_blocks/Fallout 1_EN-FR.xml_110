we are your masters
you cannot fight the chosen
your attack only makes me laugh
you cannot defeat me
oof you cannot survive
why you attack me there
you asked for this
your number is up
you broke my arm
you broke my arm
i ain t for this
this is what we do to vermin
this is what we do to vermin
oof my ribs hurt
what did you expect
i ain t for this
is that the best you can do
oof my ribs hurt
there goes my knee
there goes my knee
