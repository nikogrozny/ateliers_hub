i won t change my mind
you can
i wanted to achieve this by allying myself with the most powerful ruler of the world
the ax has no mind and has it
complained of severe punishment
complained of severe punishment
complained of severe punishment
undeniably an interesting personage
a wizard
a bit more enthusiasm
a bit more enthusiasm
it will stop raining someday
it will stop raining someday
the prince changed s cup the one who received from the priest had a poisoned bottom
combat mage
combat mage
not murder plain justice
ugh what was that
so many crowned heads in one place you must be pleased
you have it coming
