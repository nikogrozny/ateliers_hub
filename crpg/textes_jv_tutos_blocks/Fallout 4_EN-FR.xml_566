certain workshop objects won t function without someone to work them and that requires workers some workshops will already have workers available when you gain access to them to attract new workers to your workshop build a recruitment radio beacon power gt miscellaneous to assign a friendly worker to a workshop object hold to enter the workshop menu highlight a settler and press activate to put the settler into command mode then highlight an object or bed and press activate again to assign the settler to it in some cases a settler can only work on a single object stores for example however settlers can work on multiple food and defense producing objects at once when you assign a settler to work at a food or defense object they will automatically begin working at any objects without a worker of the same type highlighting a settler will also highlight any objects they are currently assigned to so you can see what they are currently working on
many workshop objects require power to function to provide power to an object you ll need to hook it up to an existing generator or build a new one from the workshop menu resources gt power gt generators power is shared between most objects by wires you can run a wire between two objects by highlighting one of the objects and pressing objects that are within range of the wire will be highlighted in white highlight one of them and press again and the two objects will now be connected by a wire all objects that are connected together by wires are considered a power grid and can use all power produced within the connected grid this means you can hook up multiple generators into a power grid in order to provide power to everything on the grid the direction of the wires doesn t matter power can flow freely around the grid as long as there is some wired connection between the generator and the object that needs power highlighting a generator will also highlight all objects that are part of its power grid highlighting an object that requires power will also show if it is currently powered if the requires power icon is red then the object isn t currently receiving power this means that either the object isn t hooked up to a power source at all or that the power grid that it is attached to is overloaded there isn t enough power on the grid to supply all the objects that need it wires have a limited range if you need to run wires a long distance use power connectors to bridge the gap resources gt power gt connectors amp switches these include switched versions which allow you to turn power on and off to anything connected to the switch some objects such as receive power simply from being near a power connector like a power pylon rather than using a direct wired connection
attracting new settlers if you befriend an existing settlement there may already be people living at your workshop but you can attract new people to your settlements by building a recruitment radio beacon resources gt miscellaneous while you have one of these beacons active at a workshop location there s a chance each day for new settlers to come live at your workshop moving settlers between workshop settlements you can move a settler to a different workshop settlement highlight the settler and press to display the list of your workshop settlements select a new settlement and the settler will travel to the selected location and live there supply lines once you acquired the local leader perk you can create supply lines between your workshops highlight a settler in one of your settlements and press melee to display a list of workshop settlements select the settlement you want to link to this settlement the settler will now be assigned to supply line duty and will travel between the settlements if you ever want to remove the supply line simply assign the settler to some other work object linking your settlements with supply lines provides the following benefits when building at a workshop you can use the inventory of all linked workshops linked workshops can share resources this means if you have a surplus of food at one settlement you can link it to a settlement with a food shortage happiness the workshop interface displays the current happiness of your settlement it can go up or down depending on what resources are available for the settlers who live there the basics that each settler requires to be happy are bed each settlers needs a bed a bed under a roof is even better the interface will show beds in red if there isn t currently one bed for each settler food and water each settler needs food and water per day to be happy this food and water can come from current production resources stored in the workshop s inventory or from other workshop settlements linked with supply lines see below defense the higher the overall defense value the happier settlers will be some objects actually produce happiness this contributes to the total happiness of the settlement settlers can also become unhappy due to events such as raider attacks kidnappings etc note that happiness unlike other reported values doesn t change instantly it moves up or down over time based on the current state of the settlement so if you provide needed food and water to an unhappy settlement you won t see the happiness rating change immediately but you will see it increase over time in the same way if for example a raider attack destroys all of a settlement s crops or water supplies they won t become instantly unhappy you ll have time to correct the problem before your settlers become dangerously unhappy why should you care about happiness the higher a settlement s overall happiness the more productive your settlers will be also if happiness goes too low you may lose control of a settlement
workshop settlers and happiness
your settlements require a variety of resources to function food water shelter if all your citizens needs are met it will increase the settlement s happiness the higher a settlement s overall happiness the more productive your settlers will be if happiness goes too low you may lose control of a settlement the workshop interface displays the current happiness of your settlement it can go up or down depending on what resources are available for the settlers who live there the basics that each settler requires to be happy are beds each settler needs a bed a bed under a roof is even better the interface will show beds in red if there isn t currently one bed for each settler food and water each settler needs one food and one water per day to be happy this food and water can come from current production resources stored in the workshop s inventory or from other workshop settlements linked with supply lines see the workshop settlements entry for more info on supply lines defense the higher your settlement s overall defense value the happier your settlers will be some objects actually produce happiness this contributes to the total happiness of the settlement settlers can also become unhappy due to events such as raider attacks kidnappings etc note that happiness unlike other reported values doesn t change instantly it moves up or down over time based on the current state of the settlement so if you provide needed food and water to an unhappy settlement you won t see the happiness rating change immediately but you will see it increase over time in the same way if for example a raider attack destroys all of a settlement s crops or water supplies they won t become instantly unhappy you ll have time to correct the problem before your settlers become dangerously unhappy
