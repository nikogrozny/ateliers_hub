you broke my arm
you broke my arm
gasp don t hit me
oof gasp argh ow
atom fire
what did you expect
ow you broke it
nobody seals my tomb
ow you broke it
ow you broke it
you pay for this later
human weapons cannot harm me
nobody save you now
you cannot fight the chosen
was that an attack
we are the chosen
i laugh at your feeble attack
why you attack me there
must escape
you pay for this later
