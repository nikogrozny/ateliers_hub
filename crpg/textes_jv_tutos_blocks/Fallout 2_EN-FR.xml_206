my hand
you broke my arm
gotta learn that move
you ok down there
we will meet again
arroyo will regret casting me out
oooo that gotta hurt
you cannot hurt me
we will meet again
you cannot kill the great
you cannot hurt me
you cannot hurt me
let teach you new skills he has learned
you cannot hurt me
you are no match for
you cannot hurt me
i laugh at your feeble attack
you can hurt me but you cannot win
why you attack me there
why you attack me there
