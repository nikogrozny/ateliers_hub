blame s not important
the institute created that so the institute is responsible for what it does
i disagree a is no more inherently evil than a handgun
the blame rightly falls on he who pulled the trigger
unfortunately no advancement comes without occasional setbacks
nothing special
destroy them
if the are intelligent and self aware then they have a right to free will
there is no need for such drastic action we are constantly working to correct any flaws that might arise
reset his what
jesus what a mouthful
to reset the s cognitive functions speak the recall code out loud the code is gamma epsilon
alright but make it quick
b initialize factory reset authorization gamma epsilon
use recall code
use recall code
don t throw away a smart deal
then you must be out of your damned mind
i fear this will not end well
a wise choice soldier
