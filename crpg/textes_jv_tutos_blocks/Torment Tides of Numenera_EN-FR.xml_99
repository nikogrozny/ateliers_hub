let s continue on
wait here for me
to action
action here i come
i am the very soul of action
you never had a chance
fall before my mighty stroke wait that sounded wrong
who invented pain anyway
glory has a new name
you know you can t die stop fooling around
has no did you die how did i miss that
i succeeded in failing
have a helping of this
how did i miss
i learned something new
my understanding has increased
you dare strike me
my cyphers are making me ill
much better
forward onward
