the settlement of megaton
report from first survey party
author moira brown researcher amp this moderate guidebook contains little of use to experienced wasteland survivors but could be considered a decent beginner s guide it shares some of the finer points of survival in the wasteland but is burdened by rambling notes about mutated creatures and naively misinformed suggestions about rebuilding humanity its direct and clear presentation helps some but not enough to make up for some of the poor content
author moira brown expert researcher amp this sturdy guidebook contains a wealth of knowledge for any wasteland wanderer the pages are studded with good advice about survival in the wasteland and overcoming its denizens only slightly hindered by impractical suggestions about high minded ideals such as rebuilding humanity its straight forward and no nonsense style makes this a very useful field guide despite its minor flaws
