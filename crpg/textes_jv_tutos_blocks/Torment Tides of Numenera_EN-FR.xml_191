the final image appears the metal ball wound through with creative explosions stellar eyes dimensional mandalas and gifts from machines turns into a single ball of coherent light much like the one that you see before you now it shows you wearing a ring of lightning and then the orb settling into your open mouth and then the series starts again you have the strangest feeling that no time has passed at all since the images began playing
the final image appears the metal ball wound through with creative explosions stellar eyes dimensional mandalas and gifts from machines turns into a single ball of coherent light much like the one that you see before you now it shows you wearing a ring of lightning and then the series smudges away leaving you with the taste of ashes
pick up the ring
stop the fragile orb with your hand
as gentle as you are the slightest touch shatters the orb
weakened by the flames it shatters in your hands
suddenly you realize that the fragments of the four items in the room can be cobbled together to create a single item you can imagine the orb book coral and chalice together perhaps you can craft something from them
grab the ring
on the orb s pedestal you notice a small nearly invisible depression about centimeters square
the depression on the pedestal attracts your attention
you know that the chalice requires your attention but you also know that you must be in the right frame of mind to understand it
use the pieces of the orb of insight to try to repair the damage to the chalice
you recall that memories are like wind like tears in the rain and with this as your guide you set about restoring the chalice with your breath and with your sweat what takes shape under your hands is not perfect but it has reversed some of the worst damage
examine the chalice closely
suddenly you realize that the fragments of the four items in the room can be cobbled together to create a single item you can imagine the orb book coral and chalice together perhaps you can craft something from them
you raise your voice you thunder at the chalice you issue stentorian proclamations all to no avail your boastful mien does not intimidate the chalice
destroy the chalice
pick the chalice up
continue anyway
the answer is simplicity itself if the liquid was formed by breath then you must be able to breathe it you inhale above the lip of the chalice and the liquid rises into your mouth
