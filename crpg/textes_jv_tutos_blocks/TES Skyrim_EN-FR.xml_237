did you just talk
barbas at your service
so what s your heart s desire what kind of deal can we strike
mind your own business
there is a certain beast in these lands large majestic
may hircine guide our blades
how long will it be sung my feet were set upon the rock but it turned to mud and drew me down
the elder scroll gives insight deeper than the deep ones though to bring about the opening
the point of puncture of first entry of the tapping
so where is the scroll
what s your offer
what sort of message
it does not
whatever it is those are up to they cannot be trusted
none can stand against the wolf queen
you can t hide from me
okay just this once
what are you staring at you worthless piece of gutter trash i simply must start locking the doors again
this is an orphanage not an inn begone from here
i been expecting you
