grab him cut off his thieving hand
this is a circus
side show thing more
evil evil and ire
you asocial social outcast
humans and their diversions
guards catch the thief
save yourselves
a scandal in flotsam
don t hit me
hm a witcher here
guards stop the thief
not yours don t touch it
punch his teeth out
neither here nor there
this is a decent inn you freak
just wait till mum finds out
don t touch that
this is your chance
yeah you seem close
