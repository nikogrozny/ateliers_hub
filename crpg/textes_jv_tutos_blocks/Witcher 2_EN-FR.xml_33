just you and me
commandant s gone mad
they ll spread you on the pitchfork
we attack
the tael bite hardest
damn her water broke change of plans
damn her water broke change of plans
i turn to hearing
the tael bite the hardest
what s your goal
plus in such company
to the point
wait the tower s locked the soldiers upstairs guard the keys
i will not take the chance
i won t take the chance
you can rely on him
you can rely on him
you can rely on him
from the port side and from the river
one note
