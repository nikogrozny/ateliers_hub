further investigations into the u f o have confirmed our suspicions on the evening of may an alien craft of unknown make and origin did indeed breach the airspace just north of maryland and crashed into a heavily wooded non residential area unfortunately attempts to retrieve the craft proved unsuccessful it simply could not be located either due to some kind of advanced invisibility shielding or because the occupants managed to make repairs and vacate the crash site before our arrival despite our failure of recovery the significance of this event cannot be denied we are not alone

subject gt laser rifle pistol researcher gt j t analysis gt further research regarding laser weaponry has not revealed much we didn t already know small production run of prototype weapons developed by us military critical components gt power drawn from micro fusion cell is processed through a wave particle diverter manuf gen atomics intnl diverters are protected by carbon fiber housing preventing frequent malfunction but when a diverter fails the weapon becomes unusable and this part is extremely difficult to replace or repair precision cut lenses focus optic energy lenses are prone to damage and can grossly affect precision of the firing weapon s firing mechanism lenses are easily replaced with any clear glass but require a great deal of skill to fabricate field operation gt a fully charged cell will discharge bolts from a pistol and shots from the rifle model recoil is negligible compared to ballistic weapons so long range combat requires less marksmanship ability of the soldier maintenance gt the chassis are easily opened allowing the weapon to be serviced in the field purified water and a clean cloth can be used to wash mirrored and glass components slowing wear on the weapon the weapon can also overheat after a period of intense use this can be counteracted by submerging the barrel of the weapon in water which helps cool heat sinks located beneath the chassis shell in that area
