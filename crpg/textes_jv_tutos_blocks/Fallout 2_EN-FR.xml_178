we will meet again
you cannot kill the great
you cannot hurt me
you cannot hurt me
let teach you new skills he has learned
you cannot hurt me
you are no match for
you cannot hurt me
i laugh at your feeble attack
you can hurt me but you cannot win
why you attack me there
why you attack me there
you pay for this later
human weapons cannot harm me
i see enemies to destroy
nobody save you now
you cannot fight the chosen
was that an attack
we are the chosen
damn that arm hurts
