its scent is unfamiliar
red sand slows the feet
you do not share
it is a sick one
it has no clothes
why is it here
you talk too much
it will leave now
you are too easily caught
warm greetings the speaks
warm greetings the speaks
warm greetings the speaks
warm greetings the speaks
warm greetings the speaks
its scent is unfamiliar
red sand slows the feet
it is a sick one
it has no clothes
why does it approach
you do not share
