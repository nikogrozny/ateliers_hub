wait a minute hold on can t we talk this over
wait
my lungs are on fire
so sleepy must rest
hey who re you
halt who goes there
you see a person in powered armor
move on
button up
this is no drill repeat no drill
start containment procedures
my feet are killing me
this is no drill
all units report in
returning to duty station
bravo team reporting in
gamma team reporting in
talk to the elder
how did we offend these evil spirits
i insist upon being freed
