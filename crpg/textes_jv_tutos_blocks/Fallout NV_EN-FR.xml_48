script this simple script merely turns off on a variable in an associated quest s script we use this trigger to tell the quest script that players are in position for a special event to be spawned nearby jorge begin player the quest script admits encounters based on how long ago its last encounter was played then no other trigger has already kicked off the event then set the related quest script to run every seconds that script will return its frequency to secs once its done with precise timing operations set to set variable in quest script that kicks off an event set to end
this quest script runs the bulk of its code when players are in the boulder city encounter region and once they cross certain triggers the possible events are randomized and played in different markers near the triggers depending on which trigger kick started the event selection once an event begins to play the triggers will not be able to start another event until a few days have passed this is an expanded version of the i made for wasteland random encounters jorge short this variable prevents the code from re placing an encounter immediately or after some time after it does its functions short this variable is set to whenever players cross a pertinent trigger volume and it s time for another event calculated in the trigger short this variable turns or depending on the trigger that starts the event northward southward short this variable is an integer to represent all possible selected events it preserves events once picked in case code needs returns before finishing short this variable is an integer useful in skipping code to the next frame when enabling to prevent crashes short this variable is turned to after a khan event and can spawn harder khans depending on reactivity float this variable holds the time game days of the last event played so as to control how often gets reset float put region here if players not in pertinent region skip code return else the region is ready to play an event players have just crossed the pertinent trigger this script s update time gets set to secs in the trigger script set to set a random number to pick from some available combinations of events if thirty percent chance to play one among the first set of events or event one to three if already picked if set to if use markers suitable for when players
