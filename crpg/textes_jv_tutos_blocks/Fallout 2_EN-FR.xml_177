save our celebrities
you have dirty energy
sully not our sanctum
this is for oz
your energy is misaligned
you have dirty energy
that will reset your anodynes
my touch will purify you
this will optimize you
your anodynes are clogged
here comes another attack
my aqueous humor my vitreous humor
my hand
you broke my arm
gotta learn that move
you ok down there
we will meet again
arroyo will regret casting me out
oooo that gotta hurt
you cannot hurt me
