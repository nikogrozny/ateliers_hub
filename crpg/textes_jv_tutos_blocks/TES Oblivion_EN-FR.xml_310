find comfort in your powerlessness
light guide you brother
light guide you sister
did that just happen
may your walls stand secure
be wary the shadows
set to
i live to serve
a glorious existence truly
goodbye and watch yourself
be careful around here
don t touch anything
does the air seem thicker than normal
may enrich your mind and guide your heart
the altar of awaits
the walls have ears
be wary the shadows
the altar of awaits
until we meet again
be vigilant is a snake
