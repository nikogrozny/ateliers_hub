you son of a
you asked for this
why did you start this
you can t handle me
you broke my arm
you must be used to fighting men
is that the best you can do
we are the masters of combat
you can t touch the brotherhood
you broke my nose
you broke my arm
you broke my arm
you busted a rib
ow my training did not prepare me for this
hold on a second
you cannot touch the brotherhood
this one is mine
here comes the thunder
your skills are weak
is that the best you can do
